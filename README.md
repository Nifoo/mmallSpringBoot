# mmallSpringBoot
This is a personal Java Web e-commerce platform project based on SpringBoot/SpringMVC/Mybatis/MySQL.
This project covers User, Product Category, Product, Cart, Shipping, Order, Payment modules for common users and administrators seperately. All the modules are implemented with complete functions and reliable logic. All the modules except Order part are fully tested using Postman.

Most of the inspiration come from the course "Java: Practice of E-Commerce Project, Form 0 to enterprice-scale - Backend" on imooc.com.

Also made some adjustments here like: 
use SpringBoot intead of traditional Spring; 
use AWS_EC2 as Nginx/TCP static server instead of Aliyun server;
use Stripe (https://stripe.com/) credit card charging API as payment interface instead of Alipay;
and some other detailed implementations.
